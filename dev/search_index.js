However, to enhance flexibility in working with image data, it is possible to leverage several different kinds of \"views.\" Generically, a view is an interpretation of array data, one that may change the apparent meaning of the array but which shares the same underlying storage: change an element of the view, and you also change the original array. Views can facilitate processing images of immense size without making copies, and writing algorithms in the most convenient format often without having to worry about the potential cost of converting from one format to another.","category":"page"},{"location":"views/#","page":"Views","title":"Views","text":"To illustrate views, it's helpful to begin with a very simple image:","category":"page"},{"location":"views/#","page":"Views","title":"Views","text":"julia> using Colors\n\njulia> img = [RGB(1,0,0) RGB(0,1,0);\n              RGB(0,0,1) RGB(0,0,0)]\n2×2 Array{RGB{N0f8},2} with eltype RGB{FixedPointNumbers.Normed{UInt8,8}}:\n RGB{N0f8}(1.0,0.0,0.0)  RGB{N0f8}(0.0,1.0,0.0)\n RGB{N0f8}(0.0,0.0,1.0)  RGB{N0f8}(0.0,0.0,0.0)","category":"page"},{"location":"views/#","page":"Views","title":"Views","text":"which displays as","category":"page"},{"location":"views/#","page":"Views","title":"Views","text":"(Image: rgbk)","category":"page"},{"location":"views/#","page":"Views","title":"Views","text":"DocTestSetup = quote\n    using Colors, ImageCore\n    img = [RGB(1,0,0) RGB(0,1,0);\n           RGB(0,0,1) RGB(0,0,0)]\n    v = channelview(img)\n    r = rawview(v)\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"views/#","page":"Views","title":"Views","text":"Most commonly, it's convenient that all dimensions of this array correspond to pixel indices: you don't need to worry about some dimensions of the array corresponding to \"color channels\" and other the spatial location, and you're guaranteed to get the entire pixel contents when you access that location.","category":"page"},{"location":"views/#","page":"Views","title":"Views","text":"That said, occasionally there are reasons to want to treat RGB as a 3-component vector.
